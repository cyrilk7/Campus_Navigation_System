# Campus_Navigation_System

### Introduction
Ashesi University is a private, non-profit university located in Berekuso, Ghana. The university is situated on about one hundred acres of land 
in the Eastern region. The various university departments, student dorms, cafeterias, and recreational facilities cover the scope of this area. 
Due to the large size of the institution, at times, navigation can be a bit problematic, especially for newcomers and visitors. Students frequently 
get lost on the way to class or meetings, and occasionally find themselves being late. 
The university recently provided a digital map of the campus to address some of these difficulties, but a more efficient solution is needed. 
The goal of this project is to provide effective campus navigation by using the knowledge acquired in artificial intelligence over the course 
of the semester to determine the shortest path between two points on the university campus and display that route to the user.
